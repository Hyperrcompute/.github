# 🚀 HyperrCompute

**HyperrCompute** is a decentralized GPU & compute marketplace—empowering users to spin up secure, ephemeral Docker environments via a peer‑to‑peer network built with `hyperdht`. Ideal for anyone needing on-demand, remote compute resources.

---

## 🔍 Highlights

- **Peer-to-peer compute network** using lightweight Docker containers  
- **Secure access** via private connection strings, similar to SSH keys  
- **Web UI over TCP tunnels** for interactive sessions  
- **Ephemeral compute jobs** with time limits, force-run, and live mode support  
- **Built with** Docker, Node.js, and decentralized networking

---

## 📦 Quick Start

Install globally:

```bash
npm install -g hyperrcompute@latest
Start a provider node:

bash
Copy
Edit
hyperrcompute <PRIVATE_CONNECTION_STRING> --port <PORT>
Launch a live compute job:

bash
Copy
Edit
hyperrcompute \
  --image ubuntu \
  --time 600 \
  --force \
  --live \
  --connector <YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING>
🛡️ Treat your connection strings like SSH keys—keep them safe & rotate regularly.

🧠 Use Cases
ML workloads: Temporary GPU nodes for training or inference

CI/CD pipelines: Disposable clean‑room environments

Collaborative dev work: Shared compute for pair programming or live demos

Education & prototyping: Launch containers on-demand without local setup

🧪 Behind the Scenes
✔️ Secure networking via hyperdht

🔄 Containerized execution powered by Docker

⏱️ Runtime controls: timeouts, forceful starts, live monitoring

🔑 Authentication ensures authorized access

🧩 Modular plugin‑style architecture
